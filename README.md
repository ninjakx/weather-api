# WeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 4.3.0.
In this, Fusion Chart is used for plotting the graph and Apixu api is used to retrieve the data.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

## Note: 
*They have updated the api so it won't work any longer. Earlier historical for few days and forecast data were free using this api. But now you have to suscribe for that plan. No longer free now.*
